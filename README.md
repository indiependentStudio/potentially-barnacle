This is an *awesome* website!

Looking at a __fetch__ cycle.

I should get to coding at some point.
* HTML
* CSS

```html
<HTML>
    <HEAD>
        <TITLE>My awesome webpage!</TITLE>
    </HEAD>
</HTML>

Underscores

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
